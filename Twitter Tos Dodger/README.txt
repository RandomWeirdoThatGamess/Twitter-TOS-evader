Use this at your own risk, I am just a retard on the internet and evading twitter tos might not be the most sustainable thing for your account.
Having said that for normal people this might give a bit of extra security to their account since twitter tos seems to just be a bot looking for key words.

Load Twitter Tos Evader.exe to evade twitter tos, change text by copying it to the clipboard, once copied it will automatically modify the text instantly, to get the text out of the clipboard paste it.

You can add key words by using listModifier.exe type the word in and it will add it, add a negative to remove the word instead, words with spaces can be added.
If you type *Clean* in the listModifier all duplicates in your banned words get removed.

GoThroughList.exe goes to every word in the list and asks you wether or not you want to keep it and all words you don't want to keep get removed.
